# Glyph Mirror

A RoboFont extension that renders a mirrored glyph in the background which updates as you edit your drawing, to make it simple and quick to achieve symmetry.

This can be helpful in cases such as:
- Achieving vertical symmetry in a glyph like `C`.
- Achieving horizontal symmetry in a glyph such as `arrowup`.
- Achieve vertical and horizontal symmetry in a glyph like `O`.

(Obviously, geometric symmetry isn't necessarily _optical_ symmetry, so use this tool judiciously.)

Mirror Glyph lives in the RoboFont Inspector for easy access.
