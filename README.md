# Mirror Glyph

Renders a mirrored glyph in the background, which updates as you edit your drawing, to make it a snap to achieve symmetry.

This can be helpful in cases such as:
- Achieving vertical symmetry in a glyph like `C`.
- Achieving horizontal symmetry in a glyph such as `arrowup`.
- Achieve vertical and horizontal symmetry in a glyph like `O`.

Obviously, geometric symmetry isn't always _optical_ symmetry, so this tool will be more or less useful depending on the type style you are designing.
